TODO other way to display bookmark info
  I show bookmark info in page now.
  I must wait when page loading complete.
  Better way must be.

When we open profile with opened tabs
  we have tabs.onUpdate for every tab 
    do i need handle this events
    My intention was handle tabs.onUpdate for new tab or user interaction with tab

DONE? cache (url to bookmark folder) is not required?
  It complicated code.
  Do not give optimization?

DONE optimization
  events tab.onCreate? tab.onUpdate(2), tab.onActivate, windows.onFocusChanged
    results in I get bookmarkInfo three+ times

    need caching for last tab//, and url

  scenario
    open link from bookmark
    open link from page
    new tab, type url
    tab with content, enter new url

DONE show number if bookmarks has one+ bookmarks for this url

DONE bkm-info-sw.js:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
  may be too early chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId
    tab is not ready
      tabs.onUpdate(status='complete')
  after comment. no errors
     // // listen for tab switching
     // chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(TabsController.onActivated);
