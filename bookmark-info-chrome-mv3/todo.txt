on sending to Chrome Web Store
  recommendation
    replace host permissions ("matches": [ "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ])
    to use permission activeTab 
      ?using chrome.scripting to inject on active tab

    question: Do activeTab can do without user action (press extension action)
      NO 
      an extension with the "activeTab" permission only obtains access to a tab 
      in response to an explicit user gesture.
      The following user gestures enable the "activeTab" permission:
        Executing an action
        Executing a context menu item
        Executing a keyboard shortcut from the commands API
        Accepting a suggestion from the omnibox API

  I think my current solution has better performance and UX.
    

TODO other way to display bookmark info
  I show bookmark info in page now.
  I must wait when page loading complete.
  Better way must be.

When we open profile with opened tabs
  we have tabs.onCreate/onUpdate/onActivate for every tab 
    do i need handle this events?
    My intention was handle tabs.onUpdate for new tab or user interaction with tab

DONE? cache (url to bookmark folder) is not required?
  It complicated code.
  Do not give optimization?

DONE optimization
  events tab.onCreate? tab.onUpdate(2), tab.onActivate, windows.onFocusChanged
    results in I get bookmarkInfo three+ times

    need caching for last tab//, and url

  scenario
    open link from bookmark
    open link from page
    new tab, type url
    tab with content, enter new url

DONE show number if bookmarks has one+ bookmarks for this url

DONE bkm-info-sw.js:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error: Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
  may be too early chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId
    tab is not ready
      tabs.onUpdate(status='complete')
  after comment. no errors
     // // listen for tab switching
     // chrome.tabs.onActivated.addListener(TabsController.onActivated);
