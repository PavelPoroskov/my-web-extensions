on sending to Chrome Web Store
  recommendation
    replace host permissions ("matches": [ "http://*/*", "https://*/*" ])
    to use permission activeTab 
      ?using chrome.scripting to inject on active tab

    question: Do activeTab can do without user action (press extension action)
      NO 
      an extension with the "activeTab" permission only obtains access to a tab 
      in response to an explicit user gesture.
      The following user gestures enable the "activeTab" permission:
        Executing an action
        Executing a context menu item
        Executing a keyboard shortcut from the commands API
        Accepting a suggestion from the omnibox API

  I think my current solution has better performance and UX.
    my solution does not required click from user
